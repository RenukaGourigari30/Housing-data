# Housing-data
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a housing dataset to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions. The goal is to better understand the structure and relationships within the data to support more informed decision-making in housing-related analytics or modeling
 EDA is a crucial step in the data science workflow that involves:

Summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset

Identifying trends, correlations, and outliers

Visualizing relationships between features

Preparing the data for modeling
AutoViz is the main tool used in this project. It is an automated data visualization library in Python that helps generate high-quality visualizations with minimal code.
Automatically detects variable types (categorical, numerical, etc.)

Generates insightful visualizations with minimal setup

Handles large datasets efficiently

Saves time and effort during the EDA process
